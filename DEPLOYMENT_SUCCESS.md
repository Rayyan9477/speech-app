## 🚀 How to Start the Application

### Backend Setup
1. Navigate to backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install missing dependencies (if any):
   ```bash
   pip install loguru chromadb
   ```

3. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. The server will start on `http://localhost:8000`
   - API documentation: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
   - Default admin credentials will be displayed in server logs

### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

## 🔑 Default Admin Access

When you first start the backend, it will create a default admin account:
- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: (shown in server logs - randomly generated)
- **Role**: Administrator

**IMPORTANT**: Change the admin password immediately after first login!

## 🎯 Key Security Improvements Implemented

### Critical Issues Fixed:
1. ✅ **Hardcoded secrets replaced** with environment variables
2. ✅ **Weak encryption upgraded** to AES-256 with secure key derivation
3. ✅ **Authentication system added** - all endpoints now require valid JWT
4. ✅ **Rate limiting implemented** to prevent abuse
5. ✅ **Security headers added** for protection against common attacks
6. ✅ **Input validation** prevents injection attacks
7. ✅ **Role-based permissions** restrict access to sensitive features

### Architecture Improvements:
1. ✅ **User database schema** with proper foreign keys
2. ✅ **Session management** with token blacklisting
3. ✅ **Middleware stack** for security, logging, and rate limiting
4. ✅ **Secure configuration** with environment variable validation

2. **Email Verification**: Add email confirmation for new registrations  
3. **Password Reset**: Implement secure password reset flow
4. **2FA Support**: Add two-factor authentication option
5. **API Rate Limiting**: Fine-tune rate limits based on usage patterns
6. **Monitoring Dashboard**: Add system health and usage metrics
7. **Backup Strategy**: Implement automated secure backups
